# Malcolm's Big List of Game Ideas (feel free to steal)

## Fog of War
A psychological horror game about being a war refugee & trying to get to safety.
* Based on RTS-style movement & building mechanics, but with no adversary.
* The traditional 'fog of war' mechanic becomes more insidious.
* Core mechanic is managing light & sanity. Push back the fog and keep your units sane.
* Kinds of fog:
  - Black fog: Forgetfulness. Lose track of where you are.
  - Red fog: Violence. The war rushes over you.
 
## Wall-hugger game
A 2D platformer in which you are a blob of slime climbing the walls of a sewer.
* An exploration of fluid/goo physics

## Swarm game
A game in which you control a swarm of 'bees'.
* An exploration of flocking mechanics.
* There should be no central 'avatar position'. Instead you should control the parameters of the flocking simulation to move the swarm as a whole.
* Swarm enemies to destroy them and create more 'bees'.

## VR art gallery escape room
A two-player co-op escape room set in a modern art gallery. 
* Mechanics based around making eye-contact with figures in paintings & sculptues.
* Based on the Tangler from Hermitcraft series 10

## Apples & Oranges
A serious game about microeconomics and fruit.
* You control a population of agents with individual utility functions for different fruits.
* Agents allocate time to sleep & pick fruits.
* Incrementally build improvements include housing, a marketplace, factories.

## Merchant game
A game in which you are a mechant travelling through the wilds between towns to trade goods.
* Using a system of supply & demand to set prices dynamically.
* Includes 'desire paths' mechanics for establishing trails
* Includes predator/prey modelling for wolves & rabbits

## Clone platformer
Clone yourself to escape the lab.
* A 2D puzzle platformer in with a cloning mechanic.
* Control all clones simultaneously to get one of them out the door.
* Includes cloning machnics/teleporters, buttons & block-pushing
* Possibly moving platforms too?

## Cavern-sweeper
A minesweeper variant set in procedurally generated caves.

## Echo
A 2D top-down dungeon explorer set in a dark room, using echo-location particles.

## One-pixel VR
An ultra-lowres VR adventre game in which the entire field of view is one colour.
* With environmental audio spatialisation

## Sea farer
A top-down 2D sailing game with localisation & mapping mechanics.
* An exploration of SLAM algorithm dynamics.
* Sail between islands with only a linited field of vision and not absolute sense of direction.

## Teddy bear
A 2D physics based platformer in which you defeat your child's nightmare monsters with a wooden sword.
* 'Shadow of the Collossus' in 2D

## The Trolley problem
An silly 'interactive ethics lecture' in which you explore increasingly ridiculous trolley problems. 
* Stylised to look like a powerpoint presentation (splines & svgs)
* Flick switches on the track to decide where the trolley goes and who dies.

## MMOrgy 
A silly game in which you control an active ragdoll in a writhing pile of bodies. Points for rubbing body parts with other players.

## Swing Dance
A two player game that mimics the push-pull feeling of swing dance. No idea what the mechanics should be yet.
